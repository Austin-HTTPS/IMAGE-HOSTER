    <h1>Coder100 Image Hoster</h1>
    <p>A simple way to host your screenshots.</p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Many people have image vaults, so I made this public "vault".</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>The hoster can be used for a variety of purposes, but it can be mainly used as a permanent way to store an image.</p>
    <h2>Hosting</h2>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your images are private unless someone has the link. They can also be found in the <a href="https://repl.it/@Coder100/IMAGE-HOSTER-WITH-PASTE-nodejs-tool">Source Code</a>. The hoster is anonymous and we do not track uploader data.</p>
    <h2>File Names</h2>
    <p>File names are randomly generated. They contain a mix of alphanumerical letters including '-'.</p>
